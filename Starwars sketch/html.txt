                <br/>
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br/>
Not a footprint to be seen<br/>
A kingdom of isolation,<br/>
And it looks like I'm the queen.<br/>
<br/>
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br/>
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!<br/>
<br/>
Don't let them in, don't let them see<br/>
Be the good girl you always have to be<br/>
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know<br/>
Well, now they know!<br/>
<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
Can't hold it back anymore<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
Turn away and slam the door!<br/>
<br/>
I don't care<br/>
What they're going to say<br/>
Let the storm rage on,<br/>
The cold never bothered me anyway!<br/>
<br/>
It's funny how some distance<br/>
Makes everything seem small<br/>
And the fears that once controlled me<br/>
Can't get to me at all!<br/>
<br/>
It's time to see what I can do<br/>
To test the limits and break through<br/>
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!<br/>
<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
I am one with the wind and sky<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
You'll never see me cry!<br/>
<br/>
Here I stand<br/>
And here I'll stay<br/>
Let the storm rage on!<br/>
<br/>
My power flurries through the air into the ground<br/>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br/>
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br/>
I'm never going back,<br/>
The past is in the past!<br/>
<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
That perfect girl is gone!<br/>
<br/>
Here I stand<br/>
In the light of day<br/>
Let the storm rage on,<br/>
The cold never bothered me anyway!<br/>
